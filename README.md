Version: 1.0

Known Bugs/Issues:
 Sequence Memory, Chimp Test, and Visual Memory: Games
 do not stop currently playing animations if user clicks
 retry or completes a level too quickly.

 Verbal Memory: I would have liked to have added a
 weight variable so that seen words were more likely
 to be seen again.
 
 Typing: Instead of only highlighting one character
 that is being inputted incorrectly, the entire line
 will be highlighted. The algorithm is also too slow
 and cannot keep up with a typist's true speed.
